  <b>A dedicated repository for learning, applying, and experimenting with classic and modern object-oriented design patterns.</b><br>
</p>

---

### --Overview--

This repository is a curated collection of **_Object-Oriented Design Patterns_**, organized into the three primary categories defined by the _GoT_ ("Gang of Three").
```
Gang of Three
├── Behavioral
├── Creational
└── Structural
```

Each folder contains:

1) A dedicated implementation of its respective design pattern.
2) A clear and easy-to-understand explanation
3) A visual diagram illustrating how the pattern works
4) Code examples that demonstrate real-world usage

The goal of this repository is to provide a hands-on, reference-ready space for studying, practicing, and mastering OOP design patterns through clean code and visual learning.
